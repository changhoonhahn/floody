# data preprocessing 
We use the following data sets in our analysis 


1. PRISM precipitation data 
We reprocess the [PRISM dataset](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/prism-high-resolution-spatial-climate-data-united-states-maxmin-temp-dewpoint) 
to zipcode level. 


2. CMIP6 precipitation forecast data

3. First Street Foundation Flood Risk 

The [FSF dataset](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b3489960c0e942c6985d2eca471718dd&view=list&sortOrder=desc&sortField=defaultFSOrder#overview) provides 
current flood risk as well as future flood risks. 
Unfortunately the dataset is poorly labeled, so we have to clarify things.
